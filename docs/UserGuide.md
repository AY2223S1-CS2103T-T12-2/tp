## **About Swift+**

Swift+ is a **project management app** designed to help software engineering (SWE) project leads in tracking their daily 
interactions with contacts. As a project lead, you can easily record down your clients and teammates by **creating contacts**
using Swift+. Using Swift+’s **task management system**, you can assign tasks to contacts and mark tasks as completed. 
Finally, you can gain an overview of your project with our intuitive side-by-side user interface.

Perfect for SWE professionals, Swift+ is built around a **command line interface**, complete with an **autocomplete** feature. 
If you have fast fingers, Swift+ can help you manage contacts and tasks more quickly than a traditional point-and-click interface.

This user guide provides details on how to use Swift+ in your daily workflow. This guide covers how to set up Swift+ and 
use its text-based commands. Get started now by heading over to [How to use the User Guide](#how-to-use-this-user-guide)!

## **Getting Started**

This section covers how to install and start using Swift+.

### Installation

1. Ensure you have [Java 11](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html) installed in your computer.

2. Download the latest release of `swift+.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to an empty folder. This will be your home folder for Swift+.

4. Double-click on the jar file to launch Swift+. 

Congratulations! You have successfully set up Swift+.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip** <br>
The app comes with sample contacts and tasks by default. To delete the sample data quickly, you can use the [`clear`](#clearing-all-data-clear) command.
</div>

### Layout

After you open Swift+, the app will appear in the form of a graphical user interface, or GUI. In Swift+, you can toggle 
between the Contact View, which is primarily for viewing contacts, and the Task View, which is mainly for viewing tasks. 
Let's take a look at the different components in Swift+ below.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip** <br>
To toggle between Contact View and Task View, you can use the [`Ctrl + Tab`](#toggling-between-contacts-and-tasks-tabs-ctrl--tab) command.
</div>

**Swift+'s GUI:**

This table outlines the components shared by both Contact View and Task View.

### How to use Swift+ commands 

Swift+ is built around text-based commands. Before we dive deeper into the details in the [Commands](#commands) section, 
let's learn the basic components and format of a command. 

#### Flag

A flag is a delimiter that allows Swift+ to distinguish different input fields. For each flag, you would put in the 
corresponding parameter immediately after.

Refer to the [Command Format](#command-format) section on how to use flags and parameters together.

| Flag  | Corresponding Parameter |
|-------|-------------------------|
| `a/`  | `ADDRESS`               |
| `c/`  | `CONTACT_INDEX`         |
| `d/`  | `DESCRIPTION`           |
| `dl/` | `DEADLINE`              |
| `e/`  | `EMAIL`                 |
| `n/`  | `NAME`                  |
| `p/`  | `PHONE_NUMBER`          |
| `t/`  | `TAG`, `TASK_INDEX`     |

#### Parameter

A parameter represents placeholders where you input data. Usually, parameters follow immediately after their corresponding flag.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note**<br>
Some parameters, such as `CONTACT_INDEX` and `KEYWORD`, may not follow after flags.
</div>

Refer to the [Command Format](#command-format) section on how to use flags and parameters together.

| Parameter       | Corresponding Flag | Description                                                |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ADDRESS`       | `a/`               | The address of a contact.                                  |
| `CONTACT_INDEX` | `c/`               | The displayed index of a contact.                          |
| `CONTACT_NAME`  | `n/`               | The name of a contact.                                     |
| `DEADLINE`      | `dl/`              | The deadline of a task.                                    |
| `DESCRIPTION`   | `d/`               | The description of a task.                                 |
| `EMAIL`         | `e/`               | The email of a contact.                                    |
| `KEYWORD`       | Not applicable     | The keywords to search for when finding contacts or tasks. |
| `TASK_INDEX`    | `t/`               | The displayed index of a task.                             |
| `TASK_NAME`     | `n/`               | The name of a task.                                        |
| `PHONE_NUMBER`  | `p/`               | The phone number of a contact.                             |
| `TAG`           | `t/`               | The tag of a contact.                                      |

#### Command Format

To understand how a full command is interpreted, let's look at the following example.

**Example:** `add_contact n/CONTACT_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]…​`

|                    | Component Name | Meaning                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **`add_contact`**  | Command Word   | Tells Swift+ what command you wish to execute.          |
| **`n/`**           | Flag           | Distinguishes input fields.                             |
| **`CONTACT_NAME`** | Parameter      | Represents placeholder for data that you wish to input. |

Notice how `t/TAG` is wrapped in `[ ]`. Items in square brackets are **optional**. 
- For example, `n/CONTACT_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John t/friend` or as `n/John`.

Furthermore, notice how `[t/TAG]` is followed by `…`​. Items followed by `…`​ can be used **multiple times**, including 
zero times. 
- For example, `n/CONTACT_NAME [t/TAG]…​` can be used as `n/John` (i.e. 0 times), `n/John t/friend`, `n/John t/friend t/family`, and etc.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note**<br>

- Parameters can be in **any order**.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/CONTACT_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/CONTACT_NAME` is also acceptable.
- If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the **last occurrence** of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/1234 p/5678`, only `p/5678` will be taken.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list_contact`, `exit` and `clear`) will be **ignored**.<br>
  e.g. if your specify `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
- Contact and task name should only contain alphanumeric characters, commas, hyphens, apostrophe and spaces.<br>
  e.g. `n/Dr. John-Doe` is acceptable, but `n/John!` is not.

</div>

#### Exiting the program : `exit`

> Exits the program.

### Command suggestion and autocomplete

To help you familiarize with the commands, Swift+ prompts you with command suggestions as you type and can autocomplete your commands until the next user-required input.

1. Type the first few letters of a command you hope to use and Swift+ will display a suggested command. e.g. `lis`.<br>
   ![autocomplete](images/autocomplete.png)

2. Press `Tab` to autocomplete your command with the prompted suggestion.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note** <br>
- If multiple commands are possible with the current input, autocomplete only completes up to the **longest matching prefix**. e.g. pressing `Tab` after `lis` will autocomplete the command to `list_`, since there are two commands (`list_contact` and `list_task`) that start with `lis`.
- If the current input is invalid, command suggestions will not be shown. The current input will also turn red to alert you.<br>
- Autocomplete does not guarantee a valid command, unless the given syntax is followed.<br>
</div>

### Saving the data

Swift+ data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Swift+ data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:warning: **Caution** <br>
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Swift+ will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

---

## **FAQ**

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install Swift+ in the other computer. Replace the default data file `addressbook.json` with the file that contains the data of your previous Swift+.
